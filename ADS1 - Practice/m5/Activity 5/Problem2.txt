In the first while loop the elements from the queue are pushed into the stack.

In the second while loop the elements from the stack are enqueued into the queue in the reverse order.

Example: 
	if 1,2,3 are present in the queue then first 1 is pushed into the stack,then 2 and then 3.
When elements from the stack are popped then first 3 is popped and added to the queue,then 2 and then 1.
So queue consists of 3,2,1 which is reversed.
